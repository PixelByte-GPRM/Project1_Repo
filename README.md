# Group 2 Project 1: A Game Index!

## User Story
```bash
AS A website user
I WANT to use a search engine for finding games
SO THAT it is easier to find specific information on the games I choose to search for
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```bash
GIVEN that I am a user to the website 
WHEN I enter a game name and search for it on the website
THEN I expect to recieve game information for:

The Game Title
The Game genres 
An image for the Game
Where to buy the game online
A description for the game
The release date for the game
An ESRB for the game (if any)
A video in a seperate row relating to the game
If the game does not have a video corresponding with it, remove the video row
Reviews for the game in a seperate row
Games that are similar to the one searched for in a seperate row.
